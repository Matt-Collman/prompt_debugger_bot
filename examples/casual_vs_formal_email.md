**Original Prompt:**
```
Write a professional but quirky email that’s super casual but formal at the same time, and not too long or too short, with lots of personality but also concise.



```

**Bad Output:**
```
Sure! Here's a balanced, personality-packed email that strikes a casual and professional tone—quirky but not cringey, and the right length to keep attention without rambling:

Subject: Quick Question (And a Dash of Curiosity)

Hi [Name],

I’ll keep this short—but not boring. I came across your work and had that “wait, this is awesome” moment. So here I am, reaching out like a professional (but also a real human).

I had an idea, or maybe more of a spark, about how we might collaborate / help each other / start a tiny email friendship that turns into something useful. Either way, I’d love to run it by you—no pressure, no pitch deck, just a genuine conversation.

Let me know if you’re game. I promise to bring snacks (or at least good ideas).

Cheers,
[Your Name]
[Optional: Your Title / Company]
[Contact Info or Website]

Want it tailored to a specific purpose (freelance pitch, job application, partnership, etc.)? I can customize it.

**Analysis & Fix:**
1. **What went wrong in the original prompt:** The original prompt was contradictory and vague. It asked for an email that was both "super casual" and "formal," which are opposing tones, leading to confusion. It also asked for the email to be "not too long or too short," a specification that lacks clarity. The prompt's contradictory nature likely confused the model about the tone and length to aim for.

2. **What kind of response it caused:** The model produced an email that attempted to balance the conflicting instructions, resulting in an email that was quirky and somewhat professional but could be seen as trying to satisfy all the conditions at once without achieving clarity in tone.

3. **How to fix the prompt:** Clarify the desired tone and length by choosing between casual or formal and specifying the approximate length or key elements to include. Remove contradictions and provide a clear purpose for the email.

4. **Suggest a revised prompt and explain why it's better:**

   **Revised Prompt:**
   "Write a professional email with a touch of quirkiness. The email should be concise, around 150-200 words, and aim to establish a friendly tone. It's intended for a potential collaboration proposal. Please include a subject line and closing signature."

   **Explanation:** This revised prompt removes contradictions by clearly defining the tone as "professional with a touch of quirkiness." It specifies the email's length, purpose (a collaboration proposal), and structural elements (subject line and signature). This clear guidance helps the model generate a more focused and purposeful response.
