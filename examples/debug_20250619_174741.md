**Original Prompt:**
```
Write a professional but quirky email that’s super casual but formal at the same time, and not too long or too short, with lots of personality but also concise.
```

**Bad Output:**
```
Sure! Here's a balanced, personality-packed email that strikes a casual and professional tone—quirky but not cringey, and the right length to keep attention without rambling:
```

**Analysis & Fix:**
1. **What went wrong in the original prompt:**
   - The prompt contains contradictory instructions, asking for an email that is both "super casual" and "formal," which can be confusing. It also demands "lots of personality" while being "concise," which can be challenging to balance.
   
2. **What kind of response it caused:**
   - The model responded with a description of the email instead of an actual email because the instructions were conflicting and vague, making it difficult for the model to generate a specific email.

3. **How to fix the prompt:**
   - Clarify and simplify the requirements by choosing either a casual or formal tone, and specify what kind of personality traits or style should be infused. Define what is meant by "quirky" to avoid ambiguity.

4. **Suggest a revised prompt and explain why it's better:**
   - Revised Prompt: "Write a professional email with a touch of humor that remains respectful and clear. Aim for a friendly tone and keep it under 150 words."
   
   - **Explanation:** This prompt is better because it provides clear and non-conflicting instructions. It specifies a tone ("professional with a touch of humor") and sets a word limit, which helps the model focus on producing a concise and coherent email.
